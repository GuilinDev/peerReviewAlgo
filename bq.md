## Why XX company?
Because I know xx is a top internet xx company with a strong focus on xx (customer experience/cutting edge clouding management technologies). 

And there are a lot of talented people in xx creating amazing products to make people’s life easier. They are always showing strong ownership to their projects and they always want to make things perfect. Those spirits do touch me. 

I remember when I just started to lead a network monitoring system, everything is new to me. And I’m so passionate about creating great services for the customers to save their precious time and money. 

The customers of my project are telecommunication business customers. Those people need to monitor their own complex mobile netwrok systems. Our system make this process more convenient so that customers can watch the dashboard we provide, visually to see if there are unexceptional events. 

We make our system to take care of all the monitoring stuff automatically. It will detect the delay/throughput/network errors/saturation events, evaluate metrics, report them and provide suggestions and solve them automatically. The s only need to do clicks on the website to make simple decisions based on the suggestions system provide for near real-time analysis and OLAP, so that they can focus more on their own things. 

That is really similar with LogicMonitor, Which also does a great job to help customers focus on their codes. It will take care of patching automatically for hosts. That’s really amazing for customer. 

So, we have similar spirits. That’s one big reason why I want to join xx.
Secondly, the growth of xx company is so impressive, it is not only an xx (online retail shop/search engine/social media network), it also has a wide range of products like xx1, xx2, xx3, xx4(Alexa, kindle, fire tablet and TV, Amazon web service, etc). There are so many fantastic technologies and products here. I will never feel boring if I am in xx. And I’ll be excited about all the amazing things around me everyday. I can learn a lot of new technologies here. Beside that, I can also work with great people here for solutions with full-stack point of view, by engaging requirements, front-end, back-end, storage and all the other stuff.

## The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it? (earn trust, customer obsession)

### Case 1

I remember that after we first delivered the 2.11 version of network monitoringsystem to customer, which is the version that first with kafka feature and kerberos authentication feature. But the customer reported that they can not authenticate with their consumers. It is very weird cause after all the checks, all the features are running smoothly in the dev environment, but when it comes to the sensor, the authentication part will fail. 

After tracking the logs and error messages, I found that the kerberos authentication was not able to be connected at the very beginning. It seems that it doesn’t have the proper environment to run. Then I noticed that all the python related stuff in the system are based on python 3, except one module for alerting, which is based on python 2. So I double checked the document, I didn’t document the detail in the documentation. So the sensor doesn’t have python 2 environment. It is definitely a silly mistake. I apologized to my manager and the customer. And we added the updated python envrionment to a new sensor as soon as possible and sent it to customer again. 

So, after that, I learnt that I should pay attention to each small detail during the development process, and document them in time so that we won’t forget. I need to make sure that all the things I delivered are fully qualified.

### Case 2

The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I led the smart network monitoring system for the first time. The original schedule is week, but I suddenly received a message from product manager says that he will show a the demo to one customer after two days. And at that time I was working on building the alerting/aggregating system, that will be an important part of the demo. But I paid too much attention on details, I want to make everything perfect. I didn’t notice that I don’t have enough time to finish all the details. 

Last day before the demo day, my manager pointed that out. I apologized to him and then we started to figure out if there is a way to keep the demo the same as what we want it to be, but sacrificing some backend performance that customer won’t notice, cause it is just a demo. After the demo, I can rewrite the code to meet the original requirements. 

after working overtime, fortunately, the demonstration was not affected in the end. But from this mistake, I learnt that details are definitely important, but I also need to pay attention to the whole schedule, I need to always keep good communication with my teammates when I have my plan. I need to make sure that my schedule won’t affect other’s schedule.


## Most challenging project

The most challenging project is my current network monitoring system. It is challenging because I need to implement all the new features on my own. It requires me to build monitoring tools for telecommunication network for both cloud-native and legacy systems. I haven’t done too much related to docker and kubernetes before. And It also requires me to build Kafka clusters for the service. I haven’t developed any Kafka before either. 

The time is not unlimited, so I started to devote more time on the project, even my private time. I googled a lot of papers related to kafka implementation, like zookeeper connect, number of replications, suitable log retention time, and so on. When I came up with some ideas, I would discuss with my leader to make sure the plan is feasible. And then I learnt docker as quick as possible so that I can design and implement the service through container on time. Finally, all the new features have been implemented on time and we received positive feedbacks from the PM and customers. 

So through this process, I learnt that it is so important to be curious and keep learning, the more I read and learn, the more problems I can solve. The feeling of ownership is really really important, the product is just like your own child. So “I don’t know how to do it” will never be the excuse.


## Couldn’t finish tasks before deadline

I remember last time I was building one plugin in the network monitoring system, my original schedule is one week, but my manager suddenly sent me an email said that he needs to show a demo to a customer two days later. One core feature of the demo is the authentication and notification function. So I was asked to realize the function before two days deadline. If I still follow the original schedule, I definitely can not finish that. My original schedule is to let the notification function generate rules automatically based on dynamic data. But I can not finish that in such a short time. So I figured out another temporary solution with my manager, is to make it a hard coding notification temporarily, to preset all the parameters and processes. If you run it, it will behave like generating rules automatically, so for the demo, the customer will have exactly the same experience. And I can also finish that before deadline. After that, I can make it real automation.
If I couldn’t finish tasks before deadline, I will discuss with my colleagues, to discuss whether we have some buffer time, at the same time trying to figure out a way that can improve the efficiency and If necessary, I will work overtime to keep working on the task, at least to mocking the core features. After all, finishing the task with high quality as soon as possible is what we want. I’ll never sacrifice the user/customer experience or the quality of the product because of that. User/Customer experience is always the most important. I must make sure that the product I am gonna deliver is qualified. I can sacrifice my own time to try to finish the tasks. If I still can not finish the tasks, I will communicate with customers and related people, to tell them why and earn their trust. At the same time, we will try our best to finish the tasks as soon as possible.

## How Do You Handle Conflict in the Workplace?

Dealing with conflict is never easy but I will do is to make sure I tackle it head on quickly, it is the key to success. A few months ago, I was leading a a team who had been tasked with solving network monitoring plugin in some software we were designing for a client. Another software team was working on a parallel program of devops that was intended to eventually intertwine with our program. At one point, one of the senior members of the second team sent an email out accusing us of intentionally delaying their program so they could have extra time to finish their work by integrating our feature in new release. Rather than send a retaliatory email out, and escalate the conflict further, I invited him out for lunch. We sat down and talked about our two programs we were developing, and I had him walk me through his project and how it worked. I then showed him what we were doing and how the two programs would eventually overlap. During this process we realized that our work had set his team back, but that it was simply a result of the testing process we were doing. Once he realized it was an accident and in no way malicious, he relaxed, and we set about coming up with a schedule that would allow us to test our end without stalling out work on his end. We also inform our manager to let him know the problems and our solutions, this can make my manager life easier on high level scope in case in future he came across the similar situations among his team members.
Now when I work on parallel programs, I try to make it a point to seek out the other teams' progress too, and discuss game plans before the releases.

## What Would You Do if Someone Continues to Take Credit for Your Work?
I’ll show my teammate that I’ll be fair to him, despite his actions. I will publicly give him credit for his own ideas, in hopes that he’ll start acknowledging me too.

If that doesn’t work, I’ll confront him and hammer out an agreement where we can simultaneously present our ideas to our boss. Since our boss knows who came up with the idea, we can each get the credit we deserve.

It’s a different story if it’s my boss that’s taking credit for my ideas. I think part of my job is to make by boss look good, to make his life easier. As long as my boss knows what I did, I think he’s justified in presenting my work to his superiors.

## Would You Prefer Your Boss to Pay Close Attention to Your Work, or Give You Enough Room for Creativity?
With a new job, I always ask for my new supervisor’s preference in managing employees and projects. If they prefer a more hands-on approach, I would work with them every step of the way.

But if they want me to take the lead, I’ll do my best not to disappoint. The key for me is being flexible to meet the demands of my current work environment.

## What’s the Riskiest Thing You’ve Done in Your Career?
Risk depends on how we define it. What might be risky for me may be normal or conservative for you. While I’m not one for unnecessary risks, I appreciate calculated risks that push the limits of what’s possible.

So before taking any risk, in life and at work, I consider the pros and cons, as well as the ramifications of my decision. That helps me determine if a risk is worth taking.

## 14 Leadership Principals

### 1. Customer Obsession
> Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

* Who was your most difficult customer?
* Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
* When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?
* Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.

Case 1: When I led the network monitoring project at the first time, it was very challenging to me. Cause I have no idea how to build the authentication structure. In order to understand it better, I googled a lot of papers and learnt a lot of basic concepts about network authentication. Based on that, I started to work with customers to figure out what kind of problems that customers concerned the most. Cause some customers who are using our products are not professional network developers. I need to use their language to tell them the story. They just need to know when they need do the authentication to pull the data, they don’t care about how we do the authentication. All they need to do is just make easy decisions based on the suggestions we provide. The system will take care of all the other stuff. Like if they need cleaned communication device vendor configration data, the system will bubble up an authentication status alert to let the customers know, and also providing them the links to the detailed dashboards. They can choose the suggestions provided by system, like choosing the data schema and formats, and timestamp range.
So, finally, after the delivery, we get positive feedbacks from customers. I am always trying my best to listen to the customers and provide the best experience for them.

### 2. Ownership
> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.

* Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.
  Usually I tend to finish all of my tasks, that is why I try to avoid multitasking if possible, because it is better to finish one or two things, than start many and leave them undone, or halfway. But, when I was in unclear responsibilities ...
* Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.
  Come out a consesus

Case 1: 
When I worked on the network monitoring project, I was required to deploy Kafka streaming processing and create few rules for the authentication system. Our authentication system is based on various Kerberos realms, and the situations and requirements for each realms are definitely different. Since I was the person who was leading network monitoring project, I want my customers to always have the best experience. So I started to think about automate the authentication. After the agreement from my manager, I categorized the current rules and the future rules based on different scenarios and requirements. Then I wrote a bunch of shell scripts to do the automation. I also created the APIs for those authentication, so if the customer doesn’t want the rule to be enabled, they can just click on dashboard to turn it off. After delivery, we had strong positive feedbacks from customer.

### 3. Invent and Simplify
> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

* Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem. 
* Tell me about a time when you invented something.

Case 1: 
When I worked at XX, we have a ticketing system to record the development process, keep tracking all the tasks, bugs. But you know the ticketing system is a little bit crowded. It only shows a long list of tickets. With the first glance, you can hardly know current process of development. So to simplify it, I used a vis timeline to show all the tickets. Then we can see the whole process clearly through the timeline. With the timeline, we can schedule the tasks more easily. Everyone is happy with that.

### 4. Are Right, A Lot
> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

* Tell me about a time when you were wrong. 
* Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

Case 1: 
When I was building the network monitoring system through Kafka and Kerberos, I was asked to create rules for monitoring all the processes in the system. I have my initial plan to track the unique value of process names based on different sensors. 
But I don’t quite understand the behavior of system metrics (Delays, Throughtput, Errors, Satuations), so I discussed with my leader, and she disagreed with plan. Actually we want to see the alert when the events in the system are down, or nearly down. What we really care about is the count of processes. We want to alert when there is a significant drop in process numbers. So, after that I changed my design and everyone is happy.

### 5. Learn and Be Curious
> Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

* Tell me about a time when you influenced a change by only asking questions. 
* Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.
* What are you doing to improve yourself?
* If I Were to Ask Your Best Friend to Describe You and Your Goals, What Would They Say?

Case 1:
My leader asked me if there’s a way to export and import kerberos authentication, visuals more easily. Cause through the GUI side, it has the number limit and it is hard to manipulate from back end. So I came up with an idea we can utilize the RPC calling betweenn internal services between Kafka broker and Kerberos. We can write scripts to automate the loading process according to our own needs. I know that’s feasible. So finally I wrote the scripts and all the stuff in the system so that system metrics can be exported and imported automatically in back end.

### 6. Hire and Develop The Best
> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and will move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.  We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

* Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.

Case 1: 
Few months ago, there was an intern assigned to my project. He was helping me build the Kafka and Kerberos authentication in network monitoring system. But I found that he gets lost about what we are doing and what he is going to do. So, I told him that it is not as complex as what he was thinking about. I explained the metrics monitoring concepts to him one by one and categorized the things what we were doing and what we are going to do. After he is getting comfortable of the whole environment and what I need him to do, I started to assign him the specific tasks. And he is doing pretty well. 
So when new additions comes to a new environment, getting lost is quite normal. We'd better to have patience to make then get comfortable of the while environment. Otherwise the efficiency will be affected. And that will also help them get used to the working environment quickly and increase his enthusiasm and devote more to the work.

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards
> Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

* Tell me about a time when you couldn’t meet your own expectations on a project. 
* Tell me about a time when a team member didn’t meet your expectations on a project.
* Tell Me About a Time You Failed.

Case 1:
I once misread the price for a high-end product to a new customer. Of course, the customer saw it as a good deal and we immediately began processing the sale. I got sticker shock after entering the product code into our system and realizing the correct price.

I didn’t know if the customer would still agree to the sale after knowing the item’s real cost. So instead of just going for it and risk losing the sale, I asked the customer to wait while I talked to my supervisor.

I owned up to my mistake and asked for help, admitting that I’m not sure if it’s better to lose the sale than give such a steep discount. My supervisor helped me explain the mistake to the customer, and allowed me to use his manager’s discount. I still closed the sale and learned a valuable lesson in re-checking prices, as well as trusting my supervisor.

Case 1: When I was building the network monitoring system, one of the important features is to generate authentication rules automatically. But I found that if the Kafka indices are in a large scale, or we meet some edge cases,  the efficiency of the process will be very low. Cause we are generating a lot of duplicate rules from ClickHouse. So I built the L1 cache to story the previous status, and also make the main cache as one node in L1 cache layer, if there are new indexes, then the system will create corresponding new rules for them. Otherwise it will only update them or do nothing. Also if there are old rules that we do not need anymore, we will remove them. And I also created links for those rules, so that we can decrease IO throughput. It turned out that the efficiency was improved a lot.

### 8. Think Big
> Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

* What's the NO 1 accomplishment you are most proud of?
* Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.
    My proudest professional achievement is the network monitoring project I owned. I tried my best to make it look perfect and make my customers have best experience. I build the both the legacy monotholic and scalable container-based tools for monitoring from Radio Access Netwrok (RAN) to Software Defined Networking (SDN) / Network Function Vitualization (NFV), each marked data exchange evetn in these networks anomaly and malicious event will be reported to the system. And I also created the authentication system, so that we don’t need people to sit there monitoring the boring data and create rules by hands. The authentication system will do all the stuff automatically. Customers love that, cause it really saves them a lot of time and money.
* Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.
    When the first version of network monitoring system that with machine learning feature was delivered, I was starting to think about bring more automation into the system. Cause one of our core features is to analyze the events of networks (RAN, SDN/NFV). But each network has its own environment and their behaviors are definitely different, so I need to build specific judging rules and awarding rules play like a rules engine. So that it can always have good performance regarding to each environment. And I’m still working on that.

### 9. Bias for Action
> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.  

* Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it. 
* Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.
* Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
* How to handle a chanllenge?
  Due to an unexpected work emergency, my leader left town in the midst of a plugin in newtork monitoring system for a difficult client. I was assigned to create a demo from the research he left and the briefing we received a few weeks ago.
  I’ve never made a presentation on my own before, I always had my manager’s help. After going through our previous presentations, I buckled down and did the work. Two all-nighters later, I finished the presentation and earned the approval of our Director.

### 10. Frugality
> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.  There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

* Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources.

### 11. Earn Trust
> Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.  Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume.  They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

* What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing?
* Tell me about a time when you had to tell someone a harsh truth.

### 12. Dive Deep
> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

* Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.
    Create authentication rules, not only the rules, but also automate them.
    Both legacy monolithic system and container-based system.

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

* Tell me about a time when you did not accept the status quo.
* Tell me about an unpopular decision of yours.
* Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team members approach.
* If your direct manager was instructing you to do something you disagreed with, how would you handle it?

### 14. Deliver Results
> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

* By providing an example, tell me when you have had to handle a variety of assignments. Describe the results.
* What is the most difficult situation you have ever faced in your life? How did you handle it?
* Give me an example of a time when you were 75% of the way through a project, and you had to pivot strategy–how were you able to make that into a success story?
