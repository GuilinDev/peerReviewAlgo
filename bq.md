## General BQs
### Self introduction
Hi My name is XXX. I am currently working at XX company as a Software Engineer and have been working here for almost one year. Over here my responsibilities are using my skills to develop big data platform, the platform process raw data to generate personal profiles, those profiles can help business customers to find and understand their potential customers. Particualarly, I do grooming on those data and move those data among different pipelines. My daily work is conducting software development, architecture design and hotfix trouble shooting.

Prior to this, I worked as a full time software engineer at multiple companies for more than 5 years where I gained lots of experience in software engineering.

My future career goal is to dig deeply into distributed applications, to build innovative products that can help customers to solve their pain points.

### Explain your current project
#### 1. Introduce the project title - purpose of the project/why useful/motivation to choose this as your project
The project focuses on providing an easy and reliable platform to recharge mobile of any telecommunication company through online withoug buying recharge cards
#### 2. Explain the technologies and tools used 
#### 3. How was the work distributed in the team and what was your role 
#### 4. Describe the project 
#### 5. Overcome the chanllenges 
#### 6. Conclude 
Example: I have done quite a few projects in my engineering among the favorite that turned out to be very effective, reliable and very useful is ZI Recruiter. It's a comprehensive xx that could help business recruiters to efficiently connect potential candidates, which will give recruiters comprehensive understandings of candidates by their skills, nuggets, employment histories and LTL scores. We chose this project because previously our business recruiters randomly connect their candidates but they dodn't get responses in most cases, and it becomes an expensive affair for our customers. We have used Java as it is a high level programming language that has automatic memory management, user friendly data structures, portable across operating systems and its wide reach especially in middleware, made it suitable for our project. My role in this project was to build xx to make sure the ltl score is accurate and the whole project is under budget and collect feedbacks from recruiters. To start with YYYYY, using xxxx and to make it more affordable and reliable. We chose to zzz because it simple to use aaaa suitable for bbb in the cccc. The dddd can collect eeee anywhere from fffff which can be measured easily/The dddd can collect eeee anywhere from fffff which can be measured easily gggg and do the sasic hhhh with the help of iiii. The jjjj was also used so that we can use it to interface with kkkk and llll. Our project is a small effort to overcome the time consuming which occurs due to recruiters connect to potential candidates, this application can be extended easily when mmmm to help recruiters evacuate candidates with less time. With efforts of all the team members we were able to complate the project successfully within the time period that we have decided. This practical aplication gave us a lot of confidence in our abilities to take up bigger challenges and I strongly believe if I get the opportunity to start my career with ABCCompany it can provide me ample opportunities to work on.

### Why XX company?
Because I know xx is a top internet xx company with a strong focus on xx (customer experience/cutting edge clouding management technologies). 

And there are a lot of talented people in xx creating amazing products to make people’s life easier. They are always showing strong ownership to their projects and they always want to make things perfect. Those spirits do touch me. 

I remember when I just started to lead a network monitoring system, everything is new to me. And I’m so passionate about creating great services for the customers to save their precious time and money. 

The customers of my project are telecommunication business customers. Those people need to monitor their own complex mobile netwrok systems. Our system make this process more convenient so that customers can watch the dashboard we provide, visually to see if there are unexceptional events. 

We make our system to take care of all the monitoring stuff automatically. It will detect the delay/throughput/network errors/saturation events, evaluate metrics, report them and provide suggestions and solve them automatically. The s only need to do clicks on the website to make simple decisions based on the suggestions system provide for near real-time analysis and OLAP, so that they can focus more on their own things. 

That is really similar with LogicMonitor, Which also does a great job to help customers focus on their codes. It will take care of patching automatically for hosts. That’s really amazing for customer. 

So, we have similar spirits. That’s one big reason why I want to join xx.
Secondly, the growth of xx company is so impressive, it is not only an xx (online retail shop/search engine/social media network), it also has a wide range of products like xx1, xx2, xx3, xx4(Alexa, kindle, fire tablet and TV, Amazon web service, etc). There are so many fantastic technologies and products here. I will never feel boring if I am in xx. And I’ll be excited about all the amazing things around me everyday. I can learn a lot of new technologies here. Beside that, I can also work with great people here for solutions with full-stack point of view, by engaging requirements, front-end, back-end, storage and all the other stuff.

>I dug deeper and found that we could upgrade that entire section of code to make it more efficient with only a small amount of additional effort. I got the OK from my manager to proceed and we did the upgrade to the delight of the user community, since it increased system efficiency by more than 50% due to the tighter integration with the code base…   This was essentially a bolt-on addition to some rather antiquated code. Usually what other people did was to manually change the number of nodes based on the network traffic.

## Diffcult BQ

### 1. Most/challenging/proud porject, Biggest Accoumplishment (主要考察是一个meet expections的人还是exceed expections的人)

**Situation**：About two years ago when I workd as a software engineer at Exxx, I started leading a project which is about network monitoring system. It requires me to build real-time monitoring tool for telecommunication network for both cloud-native and legacy systems and I need to implement all the new features on my own. I hadn’t done too much related to docker and kubernetes before. And It also requires me to build Kafka clusters for the service. I haven’t developed any Kafka before either.

**Task**：The time is not unlimited, and I had to make sure the project could be delivered in time and under budget. 

**Approach**：So I started to devote more time on the project, even my private time. I googled a lot of real world implementations related to kafka, like zookeeper connect, number of replications, suitable log retention time, and so on. When I came up with some ideas, I would discuss with my leader to make sure the plan is feasible. And then I learnt docker as quick as possible so that I can design and implement the service through container on time. 

**Result**：Finally, all the new features have been implemented on time and we received positive feedbacks from the PM and customers, since the traffic throughtput was exceeded their excepections. So through this process, I learnt that it is so important to be curious and keep learning, the more I read and learn, the more problems I can solve. The feeling of ownership is really really important, the product is just like your own child. So “I don’t know how to do it” will never be the excuse.

### 2. How Do You Handle Conflict in the Workplace?
**Situation**: A few months ago when I worked as a software engineer at Exxx, I was leading a team who had been tasked with solving monitoring plugin in some software. Another software team was working on a parallel program that was intended to eventually intertwine with our program. At one point, one of the senior members of the other team sent an email out accusing us of intentionally delaying their program so they could have extra time to finish the work by integrating our feature in new release before that agile sprint. 

**Task**: I had to make sure the plugin should be published in time, otherwise our sprint would be postponed and rearanged. 

**Approach**: Rather than send a retaliatory email out to him, and escalate the conflict further, instead I invited him to a meeting room. We talked about our two programs we were developing, and I had him walk me through his project and how it worked. I then showed him what we were doing and how the two programs would eventually overlap. During this process we realized that our work had set his team back, but that it was simply a result of the testing process we were doing. 

**Result**: Once he realized it was an accident and in no way malicious, he relaxed, and we set about coming up with a schedule that would allow us to test our end without stalling out work on his end. We also inform our managers to let him know the problems and our solutions, this can make my manager life easier on high level scope in case in future he came across the similar situations among his team members.
I realized that dealing with conflict is never easy but I would do is to make sure I tackle it head on quickly, it is the key to success. Now when I work on parallel programs, I try to make it a point to seek out the other teams' progress too, and discuss game plans before the releases.


## Couldn’t finish tasks before deadline

I remember last time I was building one plugin in the network monitoring system, my original schedule is one week, but my manager suddenly sent me an email said that he needs to show a demo to a customer two days later. One core feature of the demo is the authentication and notification function. So I was asked to realize the function before two days deadline. If I still follow the original schedule, I definitely can not finish that. My original schedule is to let the notification function generate rules automatically based on dynamic data. But I can not finish that in such a short time. So I figured out another temporary solution with my manager, is to make it a hard coding notification temporarily, to preset all the parameters and processes. If you run it, it will behave like generating rules automatically, so for the demo, the customer will have exactly the same experience. And I can also finish that before deadline. After that, I can make it real automation.
If I couldn’t finish tasks before deadline, I will discuss with my colleagues, to discuss whether we have some buffer time, at the same time trying to figure out a way that can improve the efficiency and If necessary, I will work overtime to keep working on the task, at least to mocking the core features. After all, finishing the task with high quality as soon as possible is what we want. I’ll never sacrifice the user/customer experience or the quality of the product because of that. User/Customer experience is always the most important. I must make sure that the product I am gonna deliver is qualified. I can sacrifice my own time to try to finish the tasks. If I still can not finish the tasks, I will communicate with customers and related people, to tell them why and earn their trust. At the same time, we will try our best to finish the tasks as soon as possible.


## What Would You Do if Someone Continues to Take Credit for Your Work?
I’ll show my teammate that I’ll be fair to him, despite his actions. I will publicly give him credit for his own ideas, in hopes that he’ll start acknowledging me too.

If that doesn’t work, I’ll confront him and hammer out an agreement where we can simultaneously present our ideas to our boss. Since our boss knows who came up with the idea, we can each get the credit we deserve.

It’s a different story if it’s my boss that’s taking credit for my ideas. I think part of my job is to make by boss look good, to make his life easier. As long as my boss knows what I did, I think he’s justified in presenting my work to his superiors.

## Would You Prefer Your Boss to Pay Close Attention to Your Work, or Give You Enough Room for Creativity?
With a new job, I always ask for my new supervisor’s preference in managing employees and projects. If they prefer a more hands-on approach, I would work with them every step of the way.

But if they want me to take the lead, I’ll do my best not to disappoint. The key for me is being flexible to meet the demands of my current work environment.

## What’s the Riskiest Thing You’ve Done in Your Career?
Risk depends on how we define it. What might be risky for me may be normal or conservative for you. While I’m not one for unnecessary risks, I appreciate calculated risks that push the limits of what’s possible.

So before taking any risk, in life and at work, I consider the pros and cons, as well as the ramifications of my decision. That helps me determine if a risk is worth taking.

### 1. Customer Obsession 客户至尚 ***
> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

> 领导者从客户入手，再反向推动工作。他们努力工作，赢得并维系客户对他们的信任。虽然领导者会关注竞争对手，但是他们更关注客户 。

* Who was your most difficult customer?
* Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
* When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?
* Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.

Case:(客户至尚 + 崇尚行动)

**Problem**: When I was freelancer founder software engineer at 2017, I had two unhappy customers. I have developped them two websites that hadn't displayed as they expected. The wesites worked, but not as well as they initiatially thought and the two websites looked like they were from one template. As restaurants owners, they want the websites met exactly they wanted and should be particualr. They were threatening not to pay the second half of cost and switch their business to my competitor. I had to try to keep them as customers. I knew retaining them would be hard because the websites had been nearly finished but not met their expectations and had cost them money.

**Action**: Relationships were especially important to those two customers, and the primary component of a customer relationship, in my experience, is trust. By delivering them the faulty websites, I had betrayed taht trust. Refactoring it would not be simple and would require a lot of time, time that I would otherwise be using develop websites to other customers. But I thought the time would be worth it, because my reputation was on the line, not to mention the reputation of my studio I founded.

Restoring trust is about admitting you were wrong and, above all, listening. I had a series of meetings with the two restaurant owners, where my only goal was to listen. Not to try to sell the website. Not to promise we' do better, just listen and notes. If irst met with them as a group, and then I met separately with one by one. I listened to each of them and responded calmly. I explained to them what had happened, which was definitely my fault, and apologized. In the course of our conversations, the restaurant owners became less frustrated with the situation and were read to look ahead.

**Result**: While I didn't have the ability to give them a refund for the previous websites, in the end, they agreed to give me one more change. I knew that is still needed to deliver a quality website to completely restore trust, but not losing them as customers was a major victory. Finally I spent 4 days to deliver them the revised websites and got very positive feedbacks from the two customers.

### 2. Ownership 主人翁精神
> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

> 领导者是主人翁。他们会从长远考虑，不会为了短期业绩而牺牲长期价值。他们不仅仅代表自己的团队，而且代表整个公司行事。他们绝不会说“那不是我的工作”。

* Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished. 
  Usually I tend to finish all of my tasks, that is why I try to avoid multitasking if possible, because it is better to finish one or two things, than start many and leave them undone, or halfway. But, when I was in unclear responsibilities ...
* Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities. (discuss the spec)
  Come out a consesus
* Provide an example of when you personally demonstrated ownership. (show the design document, demo, suggest feature)
* Tell me about a time you went above and beyond.(above and beyond, means do more than you need to)
* Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?
* Describe a project or idea (not necessarily your own) that was implemented primarily because of your efforts. What was your role? What was the outcome? (auth function)
* Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What was the situation and what actions did you take? What was the outcome? (lead junior engineer)

**Problem:** 

**Action:** 

**Result:** 

Case: 
When I led the network monitoring project at the first time, it was very challenging to me. 
Cause I have no idea how to build the authentication structure. In order to understand it better, I googled a lot of papers and learnt a lot of basic concepts about network authentication. Based on that, I started to work with customers to figure out what kind of problems that customers concerned the most. Cause some customers who are using our products are not professional network developers. I need to use their language to tell them the story. They just need to know when they need do the authentication to pull the data, they don’t care about how we do the authentication. All they need to do is just make easy decisions based on the suggestions we provide. The system will take care of all the other stuff. Like if they need cleaned communication device vendor configration data, the system will bubble up an authentication status alert to let the customers know, and also providing them the links to the detailed dashboards. They can choose the suggestions provided by system, like choosing the data schema and formats, and timestamp range.
So, finally, after the delivery, we get positive feedbacks from customers. I am always trying my best to listen to the customers and provide the best experience for them.

When I worked on the network monitoring project at xx, I was required to deploy Kafka streaming processing and create few rules for the authentication system. Our authentication system is based on various Kerberos realms, and the situations and requirements for each realms are definitely different. Since I was the person who was leading network monitoring project, I want my customers to always have the best experience. So I started to think about automate the authentication. After the agreement from my manager, I categorized the current rules and the future rules based on different scenarios and requirements. Then I wrote a bunch of shell scripts to do the automation. I also created the APIs for those authentication, so if the customer doesn’t want the rule to be enabled, they can just click on dashboard to turn it off. After delivery, we had strong positive feedbacks from customer.

### 3. Invent and Simplify 创新简化 ***
> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

> 领导者期望并要求自己的团队进行创新和发明，并始终寻求使工作简化的方法。他们了解外界动态，四处寻找新的创意，并且不局限于“非我发明”的观念。当我们开展新事物时，我们要接受被长期误解的可能。

* Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem. 
* Tell me about a time when you invented something.
* What improvements have you made at your current company?
* Tell me about a time you had to think outside the box (think creatively) to close a sale or sell your product.
* What is the most innovative project you’ve worked on?

Case：(创新简化 + 崇尚行动 + 客户至尚)

**Problem:** I was in a meeting in my previous job at K-XX where the team’s Jira tasks burning figures were being discussed by the manager. Although the figures were healthy, there was concern amongst the group that the tasks digestion was not as good as it should be, due to the comparation with similar projects we did before. At the end of the meeting, I decided to try and find a solution to this problem.

**Action:** I met up with the product team, and they explained to me the bulk of the customer spending time to ask questions and keep changing their requirement, especially required to add new features of advertisements analysis. After some investigative work, I know the customer was going on Facebook and social media adverts, and it became apparent that they were not using Facebook’s tracking pixels that are designed to measure the performance of the advertising spend, instead they asked us to add those features into the new release. I quickly informed them of what I had found, and moving forward from that day on, the organization was able to measure accurately the marketing return on product.

**Result:** This allowed us to focus on the core feature development, and at the same time it saved the internal customer's time for analysis, instead to ask new requirements for development

### 4. (Leaders) Are Right, A Lot 决策正确
> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

> 领导者在大多数情况下都能做出正确的决定。他们拥有卓越的业务判断能力和敏锐的直觉。他们寻求多样的视角，并挑战自己的观念。

* Tell me about a time when you were wrong. 
* Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.(PCS init) make a decision, but also consider the opinions of the other people(PCS init)

Case: 

**Problem:** 

**Action:** 

**Result:** 

When I was building the network monitoring system through Kafka and Kerberos, I was asked to create rules for monitoring all the processes in the system. I have my initial plan to track the unique value of process names based on different sensors. 
But I don’t quite understand the behavior of system metrics (Delays, Throughtput, Errors, Satuations), so I discussed with my leader, and she disagreed with plan. Actually we want to see the alert when the events in the system are down, or nearly down. What we really care about is the count of processes. We want to alert when there is a significant drop in process numbers. So, after that I changed my design and everyone is happy.


### 5. Learn and Be Curious 好奇求知 ***
> Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

> 领导者从不停止学习，并不断寻找机会以提升自己。领导者对各种可能性充满好奇并付于行动加以探索。

* How do you find the time to stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, innovate in your work?(seminar)
* Tell me about a time when you influenced a change by only asking questions. 
* Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.
* How do you stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, or innovate in your work?(seminar)
* What can you teach me in 5 minutes that I don’t already know?(ImageMaker console)
* Tell me about a time you hired someone smarter than you.
* Tell me something interesting you’ve learned recently.(seminar)

Case: (好奇求知 + 主人翁精神 + 刨根问底)

**Problem:** When I joined the team at EXX to work on the cloud product, once two people from one business customer who should contacted our support team, but by chance contacted me to argue that they found the product frustrating to use. One customer called the product a “chore to use”; another said it was “exhausting. Then I found out that there had been no customer research done prior to release of the first version of the product. It had been primarily designed based on conversations with sales engineers. 

**Action:** I met with the IT support team to get a list of customers who had purchased this product. I then proposed a virtual face-to-face user research meeting with them so I could understand the customers and get feedback on the version they were using. Before I visited, I created a test plan of questions I intended to ask and circulated it to the working team so that I could include questions they intended to ask.

I visited four people from the customer and interviewed five end users who were the primary users of this product. My selection criteria were as follows:

  * Users who were using the cloud product currently (5)
  * Users who had used it before and are no longer using it (5)

What I learned from my research was that there were two distinct personas who were intended to use it, the Manager persona and the Executive persona. The Manager wanted to have a much more detailed view into their mobile subscriber activity and the Executive wanted to get a very high-level view. Apart from personas, I also learned that there were three focus areas of how the marketing teams worked (acquisition, upsell, and retention).

**Result:** I synthesized this research and created a customer needs matrix together with my supervisor, which acted as a key input to the product management prioritization roadmap. Our NPS (Net Promoter) score improved by 5 points as a result of this work.

### 6. Hire and Develop The Best 选育贤能 ***
> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

> 领导者不断提升招聘和晋升员工的标准。他们表彰杰出的人才，并乐于在组织中通过轮岗磨砺他们。领导者培养领导人才，他们严肃地对待自己育才树人的职责。领导者从员工角度出发，创建职业发展机制。

* Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.(junior engineer)
* What is your experience with hiring people?
* How do you ensure you hire the best people?
* Give me an example of one of the best hires of your career. How did this person grow throughout their career? What did you identify during the hiring process that drove her success?
* How do you help your employees grow?(junior engineer)
* Tell me how you help your team members develop their careers. Can you give me two to three examples of a specific person in whom you invested and how you helped them develop their careers, including one who wasn’t being successful but in whom you saw potential and chose to invest?(junior engineer)
* Give me an example of a time you provided feedback to develop and leverage the strengths of someone on your team. Were you able to positively impact that person’s performance? What were your most effective methods?(junior engineer)
* How do you manage your top performers differently?
* Give me an example of someone who was promoted one or two levels up in the organization, not just because they were a star who would naturally rise, but due to your coaching efforts. (junior engineer)
* What is the composition of your current team, and how is your team organized?

Case:

**Problem:** Few months ago, there was an intern assigned to my project. He was helping me build the Kafka and Kerberos authentication in network monitoring system. But I found that he gets lost about what we are doing and what he is going to do.

**Action:** So, I told him that it is not as complex as what he was thinking about. I explained the metrics monitoring concepts to him one by one and categorized the things what we were doing and what we are going to do. After he is getting comfortable of the whole environment and what I need him to do, I started to assign him the specific tasks. And he is doing pretty well. 

**Result:** So when new additions comes to a new environment, getting lost is quite normal. We'd better to have patience to make then get comfortable of the while environment. Otherwise the efficiency will be affected. And that will also help them get used to the working environment quickly and increase his enthusiasm and devote more to the work.

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards 最高标准
> Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

> 领导者有着近乎严苛的高标准 — 这些标准在很多人看来可能高得不可理喻。领导者不断提高标准，激励自己的团队提供优质产品、服务和流程。领导者会确保任何问题不会蔓延，及时彻底解决问题并确保问题不再出现。

* Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.(PCS latency improvement)
* Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.(junior engineer)

Case 1:
I once misread the price for a high-end product to a new customer. Of course, the customer saw it as a good deal and we immediately began processing the sale. I got sticker shock after entering the product code into our system and realizing the correct price.

I didn’t know if the customer would still agree to the sale after knowing the item’s real cost. So instead of just going for it and risk losing the sale, I asked the customer to wait while I talked to my supervisor.

I owned up to my mistake and asked for help, admitting that I’m not sure if it’s better to lose the sale than give such a steep discount. My supervisor helped me explain the mistake to the customer, and allowed me to use his manager’s discount. I still closed the sale and learned a valuable lesson in re-checking prices, as well as trusting my supervisor.

Case 1: When I was building the network monitoring system, one of the important features is to generate authentication rules automatically. But I found that if the Kafka indices are in a large scale, or we meet some edge cases,  the efficiency of the process will be very low. Cause we are generating a lot of duplicate rules from ClickHouse. So I built the L1 cache to story the previous status, and also make the main cache as one node in L1 cache layer, if there are new indexes, then the system will create corresponding new rules for them. Otherwise it will only update them or do nothing. Also if there are old rules that we do not need anymore, we will remove them. And I also created links for those rules, so that we can decrease IO throughput. It turned out that the efficiency was improved a lot.

### 8. Think Big 远见卓识
> Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

> 局限性思考只能带来局限性的结果。领导者大胆提出并阐明大局策略，由此激发良好的成果。他们从不同角度考虑问题，并广泛寻找服务客户的方式。

### 10. Frugality 勤俭节约
> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

> 力争以更少的投入实现更大的产出。勤俭节约可以让我们开动脑筋、自给自足并不断创新。增加人力、预算以及固定支出并不会为你赢得额外加分。

* Tell me how that project you were leading failed.

### Case (Entrust, customer obession)

**Problem:** I remember that after we first delivered the 2.11 version of network monitoring system to customers, which is the version that first with kafka feature and kerberos authentication feature. But the customer reported that they can not authenticate with their consumers. It is very weird cause after all the checks, all the features are running smoothly in the dev environment, but when it comes to the sensor, the authentication part will fail. 

**Action:** After tracking the logs and error messages, I found that the kerberos authentication was not able to be connected at the very beginning. It seems that it doesn’t have the proper environment to run. Then I noticed that all the python related stuff in the system are based on python 3, except one module for alerting, which is based on python 2. So I double checked the document, I didn’t document the detail in the documentation. So the sensor doesn’t have python 2 environment. It is definitely a silly mistake. I apologized to my manager and the customer. And we added the updated python envrionment to a new sensor as soon as possible and sent it to customer again. 

**Result:** So, after that, I learnt that I should pay attention to each small detail during the development process, and document them in time so that we won’t forget. I need to make sure that all the things I delivered are fully qualified.

### 12. Dive Deep 刨根问底
> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit 要有硬骨头 ***
> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

> 领导者必须能够不卑不亢地质疑他们无法苟同的决策，哪怕这样做让人心烦意乱、精疲力尽。领导者要信念坚定、矢志不移。他们不会为了保持一团和气而屈就妥协。一旦做出决定，他们就会全身心地致力于实现目标。

Case:(要有硬骨头 + 客户至尚 + 远见卓识 + 决策正确)

**Problem:** I worked with a small-market client at EXX., when the client were just making the transition to our private cloud cluster. Initially, they were just interested in lifting and shifting one of their web apps to the cloud for testing and development. The client had not paid regular acount money, making it a relatively small account. So my management team didn’t want me spending too much time getting them onboarded, but it was a relatively complex job and I wanted it done right.

**Action:** I understood management’s concerns, but I had done the architectural assessments and knew the client needs. My primary concern was doing right by the customer, but if I’m being completely honest, I saw significant upside opportunities. For one, while we had been contracted to migrate just the one web app to our cloud, the client in fact had a whole suite of apps that could eventually be migrated, if the first migration went well. Secondly, the client was well connected and would provide a reference for other work.

To convince my supervisors that this job was worth more time than usual for such a small account, I walked them through the hidden upsides. Since I had been working closely with the client I asked if I could spend time on this project until after go-live. My manager agreed, and I spent more time working on the project.

**Result:** As a result of my close work with the client, the lift and shift was finished ahead of schedule. I wrote a documentation for the client to work on the other apps, which we ended up moving ahead with, and ultimately, the total contract value of the account surpassed five figures. That job influenced how my team operated going forward, and fundamentally changed the role of Software Engineer at my company. The job was no longer only just about meeting the exact requirements of the Jira tasks, we began engaging with customer needs more holistically, always seeking to deepen the relationship.

### 14. Deliver Results 达成业绩
> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

> 领导者会关注其业务的关键决定条件，确保工作质量并及时完成。尽管遭受挫折，领导者依然勇于面对挑战，从不气馁。

### 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
> Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.


### 16.Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
> We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
