### Self Introduction

Hi My name is ..., I worked in AA for more than 9 years. I am currently working for revenue management optimizer platform
 Those products can help our system to define best price for each flight dynamically.  
 I am responsible for software development, architecture design and testing and dubuging. 
My future career goal is to dig deeply into distributed applications, to build products that can help customers to solve their pain points
Explain your current/proud project

1. Introduce the project title - purpose of the project/why useful/motivation to choose this as your project


2. Explain the technologies and tools used

3. How was the work distributed in the team and what was your role

4. Describe the project

5. Overcome the chanllenges

6. Conclude

I have done quite a few projects in my engineering, among the favorite that turned out to be very effective, reliable and very useful is called Mercury, It is platform that could help internal business users define better basic price/ fare for each markets and cabin.
My role in this project was to build constructed fare which help people who flight from small city through big city can get better price. And more willing to pay it.
We have used java and scala in the same project and use spark as main frame work on IBM cloud. It is offline batch processing. System get different airline’s data from ATPCO and we need join them heavily. 
We are able to completed project successfully. This project which replaced old platform which need pay google 1.2 million usd every year. It also provided new dailly report and better query performance under certain condition.
This practical aplication gave me a lot of confidence in my abilities to take up bigger challenges, and I strongly believe if I get the opportunity to start my career with "ABCCompany" where it can provide me ample opportunities to work on.

My current project is processing future flight level data up to 365 days(around 2.1 million flights). 
It need pre calculate each seat under every possible combination. (up to 3 cabins). and also save data for next day's calculation. 
Even input data and output data is not big. But calculation in some steps are huge. It need around 1000 * 200 * 40* 50 calculation. We use java (spring)+ kafka + XAP(In memory DB). We use java because it is good JVM and it is GC. Kafka because it able to enable these decoupled applications to communicate with each other.  
XAP because it is not relied on schema and easy to make change to your object. And also read fast. It also has replica to make sure not losing data.

## Why XX company?
I have been using Amazon for more than 10 years. I was so impressed by the online shopping experience it provided. 
Easy to search the product you want, Easy to buy and pay, and even easy to return the products that I don’t like. 
From my experience working in American Airlines, I understand how hard to make most customers happy
 and how important to make customer happy. So, to work with people who strongly focusing on customer 
 experience is one big reason why I want to join Amazon.
Secondly, the growth of Amazon is so amazing, it is not only an online shopping store, 
but also having many amazing products like Fire TV, Kindle, Alexa, Amazon web service… 
I will be so excited if I work in Amazon, that means I will have chance to work on some amazing new products also.



## Why you choose this position?

The job I applied is Software engineer in xx company yy team. 
The reason why I choose this job is I have the similar experience. 

I remember when I just started to lead a network monitoring system, everything is new to me. 
And I’m so passionate about creating great services for the customers to save their precious time and money. 


## The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it? (earn trust, customer obsession)

### Case 1

Case 1 : The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I worked on one of my project for pricing system. 

I need to do demo in front of our user about our project.
 When I show one of my function, The system crashed. Even I tested system the day before, 
 but error was caused by one very small function I add that morning, and I didn’t test fully, 
 but it caused test system crash. Then I suggest user  take break for 10 minus and I use code version from 
 the day before and make other demo going on. And explained to user I didn’t cover all test case in the function. 
The lesson even small function you think I won’t hurt anything may cause big issue to system and need test 
fully before you do any demo or production release.(小错误)

Case 2: When I was maintain one of our automation project, user reported that they feels price amount is slightly 
different after comparing to one old system which is from US AIRWAY, but they don’t know why.  
It was wired because we did not make that part of code change for some time. 
After debugging I found our system are not able to read tax data from one window based system which 
called sharepoint system. The reason is sharepoint team do upgrade during the weekend. 
and they also send out update notice email to everyone.  but I did not aware of it at that time.  
The way I bring up temporary solution is using data from our test server. 
becuase our test server sharepoint still old version. That means our dev database table has correct tax data.  
So I manually update production tax table from test environment data. 
The lesson I learn is I need pay attention to small details to all part of system and 
document them especially for the connection data from other team.

5: Couldn’t finish tasks before deadline.

When I was working on our pricing strategy system, two week before the dead line we found the output of 
our pricing data is slily different by comparing data from other airlines system,  
the reason is because the currency we were using is front one company called ATPCO. 
They update currency once a day which is fine in many case. But in the our project 
we need have currency update every hour. So we need to talk to other company called sybre.
It is hard to build this data transfer way in short time because of security consideration. 
since we are different company. 

Finally, user agree just use dailly currency for some time. it is not perfet but still works temporate
and we Finally build FTP way to transfer data after some 
time. Where I learn from this 

• Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.
• Tell me about a time when you invented something.
I told my manager that we can build one temporary solution, 
we asked sybre send us through email every hour about currency data and 
we integrate email data using our RPA tools and transfer them to our database.


## Most challenging project

Around few years ago, one of my college find new job and leaving our group, 
he was using RPA (Robotic process automation) tool called openspan to develop his project, 
I took over this project because I know it was very important for users to able run this project 
before airline busy season.  
 
The charlange is I never worked in this tool before, and I need keep reading document from openspan website
also keep talking to user for the automation process 
they want and I manually do it many times to make me more familiar 
and think about what kinds exception and mistakes we would get. Also I priority the function user need most, 
because Automation job can be done by user manually, some small job user can just manually do it.
Finally, we delivered all the function user required on time and we received 
positive feedbacks from the PM and customers. 

So through this process, I learnt that it is so important to be curious and keep learning, the more I read and learn, 
the more problems I can solve. The feeling of ownership is really really important, the product is just like your 
own child. So “I don’t know how to do it” will never be the excuse.


## Couldn’t finish tasks before deadline(任务)




## How Do You Handle Conflict in the Workplace?
When we do constructed fare project, Their is another team who also working on similar logic. our first part 
is exactly the same and second part we have different logic. in order to avoid duplicate job, that means we need made 
some changes. but who is going to made changes become a problem. since we already setup our relase plan before.
I set up meeting with their team lead and we discussed details about this project and we split each part of logic
reasign the tasks to each other. that means first part we work togeter and maintaince togeter.
Finally both team got good feedback. 
So I belive the way to handle conflict is communication, 



## What Would You Do if Someone Continues to Take Credit for Your Work?
I’ll show my teammate that I’ll be fair to him, despite his actions. I will publicly give him credit 
for his own ideas, in hopes that he’ll start acknowledging me too.

If that doesn’t work, I’ll confront him and hammer out an agreement where we can simultaneously present our ideas 
to our boss. Since our boss knows who came up with the idea, we can each get the credit we deserve.

It’s a different story if it’s my boss that’s taking credit for my ideas. I think part of my job is to 
make by boss look good, to make his life easier. As long as my boss knows what I did, I think he’s justified 
in presenting my work to his superiors.

## Would You Prefer Your Boss to Pay Close Attention to Your Work, or Give You Enough Room for Creativity?
With a new job, I always ask for my new supervisor’s preference in managing employees and projects. 
If they prefer a more hands-on approach, I would work with them every step of the way.

But if they want me to take the lead, I’ll do my best not to disappoint. The key for me is being flexible to meet 
the demands of my current work environment.

## What’s the riskiest Thing You’ve Done in Your Career?
Risk depends on how we define it. What might be risky for me may be normal or conservative for you. 
While I’m not one for unnecessary risks, I appreciate calculated risks that push the limits of what’s possible.

So before taking any risk, in life and at work, I consider the pros and cons, as well as the ramifications 
of my decision. That helps me determine if a risk is worth taking.

## 14 Leadership Principals

### 1. Customer Obsession
> Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. 
>Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

* Who was your most difficult customer?
* Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. 
What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
* When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. 
How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?
* Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.


### 2. Ownership
> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
>They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.

* Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.
  Usually I tend to finish all of my tasks, that is why I try to avoid multitasking if possible, 
  because it is better to finish one or two things, than start many and leave them undone, or halfway. 
  But, when I was in unclear responsibilities ...
* Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.
  Come out a consesus



### 3. Invent and Simplify
> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. 
>They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. 
>As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

* Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem. 
* Tell me about a time when you invented something.

### 4. Are Right, A Lot
> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. 
>They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

* Tell me about a time when you were wrong. 
* Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

1: When I work on airline constructed fare project, 


### 5. Learn and Be Curious
> Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. 
>They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

* Tell me about a time when you influenced a change by only asking questions. 
* Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.
* What are you doing to improve yourself?
* If I Were to Ask Your Best Friend to Describe You and Your Goals, What Would They Say?


### 6. Hire and Develop The Best
> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional 
>talent and will move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously 
>their role in coaching others.  We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms f
>or development like Career Choice.

* Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.

Case 1: 
Few months ago, there was an intern assigned to my project. He was helping me build helping me to work on project for 
dailly hightest fare reprort using java and spark. But I found that he gets lost about what we are doing 
and what he is going to do. He foucs a lot to how to use spark. So, I told him that it is not as complex 
as what he was thinking about. 
I draw the work flow pictures for him and ask him to clear what is input and output in each steps. and don't worry 
 about big data in the begin. After he is getting comfortable of the whole environment and what I need him to do, 
 I started to 
assign him the specific tasks. And he is doing pretty well. 
So when new additions comes to a new environment, getting lost is quite normal. We'd better to have patience to make 
then get comfortable of the while environment. Otherwise the efficiency will be affected. And that will also help 
them get used to the working environment quickly and increase his enthusiasm and devote more to the work.

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards
> Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. 
>Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, 
>and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed 
>so they stay fixed.

* Tell me about a time when you couldn’t meet your own expectations on a project. 
* Tell me about a time when a team member didn’t meet your expectations on a project.
* Tell Me About a Time You Failed.

Case 1:
For the automation, it runs in window box. I wrote for exception handling




### 8. Think Big
> Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate 
>a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

* What's the NO 1 accomplishment you are most proud of?
* Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.

    fare and rules automation system will do all the stuff automatically. 
    Customers love that, cause it really saves them a lot of time and money.
    
* Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.
   fare and rules automation.

### 9. Bias for Action
> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. 
>We value calculated risk taking.  

* Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting 
for someone else to do it. 
* Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.
* Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
* How to handle a chanllenge?
Get automation done after collegue left.

  Due to an unexpected work emergency, my leader left town in the midst of a plugin in newtork monitoring system for
   a difficult client. I was assigned to create a demo from the research he left and the briefing 
   we received a few weeks ago.
  I’ve never made a presentation on my own before, I always had my manager’s help. 
  After going through our previous presentations, I buckled down and did the work. T
  wo all-nighters later, I finished the presentation and earned the approval of our Director.

### 10. Frugality
> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. 
> There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

* Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources.
Automation when we get it no time no resources. and even don't have place to google it.

### 11. Earn Trust
> Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical,

* What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing?
* Tell me about a time when you had to tell someone a harsh truth.



### 12. Dive Deep
> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics 
>and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

* Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.
1: Automation error handleing system, and log system.
2: create data filtering rule based on airline tariff so we can reduce data processing time.


### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
